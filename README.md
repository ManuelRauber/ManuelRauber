### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Manuel Rauber. Iâ€™m a guy starting his 30's and I'm living in Germany. I've co-founded [Boundfox Studios](https://boundfoxstudios.com), a little Indie Game Development Studio, and I'm working as a consultant for the wonderful company [Thinktecture](http://thinktecture.com). From 2016 to 2020 I got awarded as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in _Visual Studio and Development Technologies_. 

By day Iâ€™m building applications with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Angular) and Node.js or .NET Core in the backend. By night, Iâ€™m <s>Batman</s> interested in testing, Unity or trying out new technology. Iâ€™ve got an open mindset and appreciate discussing about how things can be improved. Oh, and I love memes. (-:

In my spare time I'm a member of board at [Hackerstolz e.V.](https://hackerstolz.de) - a club to encourage digitalization in Germany - organizing events like Hackathons. Additionally I'm the organizer of the Meetup Group [Hackschool Karlsruhe](http://www.meetup.com/Hackschool-KA/), an event by Hackerstolz e.V. to teach programming skill to everyone who is interested. I'm also the organiser of the [Cross-Platform Afterwork](https://www.meetup.com/Cross-Platform-Afterwork/) - a Meetup Group for talking and discussing about cross-platform development - and a co-organiser of [KarlsruheJS](https://www.meetup.com/KarlsruheJS/) - a JavaScript User Group in Karlsruhe.

In October 2014 I got my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the [Cooperative State University Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Karlsruhe](https://www.dhbw-karlsruhe.de/english/general/general/). In 2015 I started studying again to get a Master Degree in Computer Science. I study at the [Cooperative State University Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg](http://www.cas.dhbw.de/) in Stuttgart, Heilbronn and Mannheim.
